## Contributions are welcome!

Powertube Player will continue to evolve. We add new features all the time, but we have too many new cool ideas.

Any help will be appreciated. You can develop new features, fix bugs, improve the documentation, or do some other cool stuff.

If you have new ideas or want to complain about bugs, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/goh-chunlin/powertube-player/issues/new).

Let's have fun building Windows Form app with PowerShell together!
